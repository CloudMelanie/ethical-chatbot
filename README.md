# ethical-chatbot
Repository for the Ethical Chatbot project for CS 3377. The instructions were to connect to Chat GPT's API and create a workable website that allowed for user input and provided a response from the API.

Project description: 
The purpose of this project is to better understand the pros and cons of ethical options.

The application prototype or wireframe must have the following components:

1. Home page screen with organization name, navigation bar (about us, how to use, home) 
2. Input box where users can type in ethical questions
3. Three button choices, For, Against, Neutral 
4. When one of the buttons is selected a result will be displayed.
