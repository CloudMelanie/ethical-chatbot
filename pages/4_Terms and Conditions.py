        At GPT Lab, we take your privacy very seriously. Our application only uses your OpenAI API Key during sessions to interact with the AI models. To ensure your confidentiality and security, we use a one-way hashing algorithm on your OpenAI Key to generate your unique user identity rather than collecting or storing Personal-Identifiable-Information (PII). We also use a symmetric AES-128 encryption algorithm, with a unique key for each user, to encrypt your chat transcripts with the AI Assistants. Lastly, we do store the AI assistant prompts, which can be reviewed and audited periodically to ensure no misuse. For more information about our privacy practices, please visit our privacy policy.
